Since we use this command so often in this class, I have memorized it and just write it out each time. We did make a bash file to run it for us before, however I find it takes more time to find that file than just write it out each time. If I already used it within this terminal I also tend to used `up up` through history or `crtl-R ssh` to find it. <br>

So, I wrote out `ssh cse15lfa23fy@ieng6.ucsd.edu <ENTER>`
